We are going to look at how to use Support Vector Machines with Python to predict the price of diamonds. For full article, feel free to visit https://learndatascienceskill.com/index.php/2020/08/06/support-vector-machines-with-python/

In this tutorial, I will show you how to perform Machine learning with Python using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), with the example of how to predict the price of diamonds based on some features such as clarity, cut, etc. I will show you step by step of:

1. How to load the data into Google Colab notebook
2. How to explore the data
3. How to pre-process the data
4. How to split the data into train and test data
5. How to train the model and evaluate the model
6. How to do prediction with using test data
